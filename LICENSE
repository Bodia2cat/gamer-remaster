Using the software, when editing the game code, I am not responsible for the result. When demonstrating the game, you must indicate the author / specify a link to my github (https://github.com/Bodia2cat) / provide a link to my instagram page (instagram.com/b_coffe__). By launching the game you agree with the words above.
